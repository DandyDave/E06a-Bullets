In this assignment for my Game Technology class at Indiana University I was first tasked with 
making bullets spawn when the mouse was clicked between limes 121 to 125. 

After I did that made sure that there was collison between the bullets and the enemies (penguins) 
and made sure the bullet disappeared on contact (lines 91 to 94). 

Then I made the enemy take damage for every bullet hit reducing its predetermined HP and 
then dying when its HP reached 0 (lines 95 to 99). 

I also had a score counter increase by 10 for every hit on an enemy and by 100 for everytime 
an enemy was killed (also lines 95 to 99).
